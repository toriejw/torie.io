%Q{#What is an object model?

An object model describes how objects in a programming language are constructed behind the scenes. This determines how a language interacts with objects.

#What does the Ruby object model look like?

Rubyâ€™s object model is built on hashes. When you create an object in Ruby, Ruby creates a hash to represent that object. The hash is made up of two keys: `class` and `instance_variables`. The value for `class` will be the class of the object.

The value for `instance_variables` will be another hash, made up of a key for each instance variable the object has, and a value to represent what each instance variable has been assigned to for that specific object. In code, an object would look like this:

    {
      class: ClassName,
      instance_variables: { }
    }

**ClassName** serves as a pointer to the object's class. A class stores information used by the object such as which methods are available to that object. Like objects, Ruby represents classes using hashes. A class hash looks like this:

    {
      superclass: ClassName,
      methods: { },
      constants: { },
      class: ClassName,
      instance_variables: { }
    }

Classes have a few more keys in their hash. When you call a method on an object, Ruby looks in that object's class, finds the `methods` key, and checks if the method you called is in the hash associated with the key `methods`.
